someone somewhere is running a bath<br>
the walls are thin but i like it<br>
in fact i used to listen in on purpose<br>
sometimes and now<br>
i feel the pulse in your fingers as you<br>
sleep beside me<br>
it is nice to know that you are alive<br>
crescent mouth hanging open<br>
tired from the day’s work<br>
fucking and doing nothing<br>
on loop on loop on<br>
it is nice<br>
sometimes i feel like you are<br>
everything and nothing<br>
all at once<br>
and i wish i could leave but<br>
i can’t<br>
i don’t know how you do it
