someone somewhere is running a bath  
the walls are thin but i like it  
in fact i used to listen in on purpose  
sometimes and now  
i feel the pulse in your fingers as you  
sleep beside me  
it is nice to know that you are alive  
crescent mouth hanging open  
tired from the day’s work  
fucking and doing nothing  
on loop on loop on  
it is nice  
sometimes i feel like you are  
everything and nothing  
all at once  
and i wish i could leave but  
i can’t  
i don’t know how you do it
