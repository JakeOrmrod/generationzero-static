title: Out Of Site Out Of Mind (2018) by Cait Sparks
---
I am an environmental artist with an ecological voice. Experimentation with site specific installations and researching bio-degradable materials are displayed in my work. Being a tactile artist I create texture using nature and plaster, plaster being the material I have been using the most in my studio practice. Site plays a large part in my art I enjoy being outdoors and using natural or found materials in my work.
 
In this piece I explore such issues through my art as waste and recycling these environmental concerns are current and growing and are more heavily presented in the press.  Artists have a responsibly to use their voice to tap into the viewers intellectual consciousness as they have the ability to emit change.
