title: drugs are boring by Jake Ormrod
---
the news is out, drugs are boring  
whether for sleep or late night fawning  
to dance all night or get you yawning  
doesn’t matter cause drugs are boring.  

underneath the social side  
that brings out traits you’ve tried to hide  
there’s something vile and much more snide  
it’s time the youth began to turn the tide  
now we know that drugs are boring.  

there’s no use for the word mingle  
once you feel that familiar tingle  
orgies, couples, even single  
turn monosyllabic from bilingual  
drugs turn everyone rather boring.  

even the ones that aren’t illicit  
the one’s you’re given during a hospital visit  
the ones that keep the mentals with it  
the ones that morph and control the spirit  
these people are forced to find out drugs are boring.  

so next time you find yourself at a party  
think that drugs could make you hearty  
remember that you’re much more quirky  
that drugs don’t equal personality  
that drugs, most definitely, make you boring.
