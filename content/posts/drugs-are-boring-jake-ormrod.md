title: drugs are boring by Jake Ormrod
---
the news is out, drugs are boring<br>
whether for sleep or late night fawning<br>
to dance all night or get you yawning<br>
doesn’t matter cause drugs are boring.<br>

underneath the social side<br>
that brings out traits you’ve tried to hide<br>
there’s something vile and much more snide<br>
it’s time the youth began to turn the tide<br>
now we know that drugs are boring.<br>

there’s no use for the word mingle<br>
once you feel that familiar tingle<br>
orgies, couples, even single<br>
turn monosyllabic from bilingual<br>
drugs turn everyone rather boring.<br>

even the ones that aren’t illicit<br>
the one’s you’re given during a hospital visit<br>
the ones that keep the mentals with it<br>
the ones that morph and control the spirit<br>
these people are forced to find out drugs are boring.<br>

so next time you find yourself at a party<br>
think that drugs could make you hearty<br>
remember that you’re much more quirky<br>
that drugs don’t equal personality<br>
that drugs, most definitely, make you boring.<br>
