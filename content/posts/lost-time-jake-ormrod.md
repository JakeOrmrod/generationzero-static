title: lost time by Jake Ormrod
---
some baby in the back end of the pub is staring at my hair<br>
and while i wouldn't usually care<br>
i'm more than a little worse for wear today<br>
and it's really getting to me.<br>

her small eyes glitter with innocence<br>
but the sticky fingers that make up her curled fist<br>
are rubbing indistinct muck into the precious orbs<br>
left to be absorbed by the optic nerve<br>
that will hopefully serve her well till old age<br>
show her the cruelty she'll fight<br>
a battle against the right in the name of decency.<br>

this isn't usual for me.<br>

i'm usually ambivalent towards kids<br>
but as i said i'm feeling fragile<br>
so my mind is reeling at the possibility inside that bulbous head.<br>
i hope she's not easily lead<br>
that she spends her life looking after the needy<br>
not pulled in by the selfish and the greedy<br>
into a life that's importance is based on a larger wage<br>
a grand stage to show off her material accomplishments.<br>

instead<br>
she will love in obscurity<br>
in the slums of the city<br>
no pity for the ones who need her<br>
always offering<br>
never demanding<br>
just standing at the precipice and screaming into the void<br>
at the annoyed<br>
who would have silence over education<br>
who would have people know their place<br>

all this,<br>
conjured up,<br>
by that baby's staring face.<br>
