title: lost time by Jake Ormrod
---
some baby in the back end of the pub is staring at my hair  
and while i wouldn't usually care  
i'm more than a little worse for wear today  
and it's really getting to me.  

her small eyes glitter with innocence  
but the sticky fingers that make up her curled fist  
are rubbing indistinct muck into the precious orbs  
left to be absorbed by the optic nerve  
that will hopefully serve her well till old age  
show her the cruelty she'll fight  
a battle against the right in the name of decency.  

this isn't usual for me.  

i'm usually ambivalent towards kids  
but as i said i'm feeling fragile  
so my mind is reeling at the possibility inside that bulbous head.  
i hope she's not easily lead  
that she spends her life looking after the needy  
not pulled in by the selfish and the greedy  
into a life that's importance is based on a larger wage  
a grand stage to show off her material accomplishments.  

instead  
she will love in obscurity  
in the slums of the city  
no pity for the ones who need her  
always offering  
never demanding  
just standing at the precipice and screaming into the void  
at the annoyed  
who would have silence over education  
who would have people know their place  

all this,  
conjured up,  
by that baby's staring face.
