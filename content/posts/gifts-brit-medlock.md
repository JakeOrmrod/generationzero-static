title: Gifts by Brit Medlock

You always had your finger at your lips, feeling for something invisible.<br> 
You pulled at the skin, at hairs that werenâ€™t there, absent-minded.<br>
I recoiled at the redness of your brow.<br>

I hated this ritual, but you gave it to me anyway.<br>

Sometimes I dared not look at your body; a decaying version of my own, weighted, puckered, drawn. I shivered at the marbled surface of your calves, at the figure they struggled to bear.<br>

The day I came and twisted you out of shape was your greatest day of giving.<br>

You gave me the curve of your shoulders, the slope of your back, your shuffle.<br>
You gave me your crooked fingers, your aching womb, your mottled skin.<br> 
You gave me your eyes, your hum, your softness.<br> 

You are mine. My other.<br> 

You gave me your lips.<br> 

I put my finger to them, fleshy and familiar. A glance in a funfair mirror.<br>
