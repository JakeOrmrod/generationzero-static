Sunshine and raindrops<br>
pissing prisms on a hardlined face<br>
salted kitten tears lick my cheeks and chafe<br>

Chattering teeth mapped with spider cracks<br>
drum out your name to the morning<br>
and pleasant lies drift from harelip skies<br>
and settle like snow on my shoulders.<br>

Press me down while I play tic-tac-toasting<br>
marshmallows on a fire that hisses and spits like asps<br>
(asking me to stay in fitted gasps)<br>
a rushing breath too sweet to last<br>

The day shakes loose as trees fall down,<br>
shuddering the earth,<br>

burying squirrels in mounds of acorns, their shells torn off<br>

Ask me again how the sparrows sing softly -<br>
Was that tune a song for you?<br>
The whistling is born aloft by the swirling breeze<br>
(with just a hint of chill)<br>
enough to raise the hackles,<br>
and hold yourself in a lovers embrace.<br>
