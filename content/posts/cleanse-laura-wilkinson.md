title: Cleanse by Laura Wilkinson
---
Why oh why<br>
When I was sat tucking into my pie last night<br>
Did a man behind me laugh<br>
When he heard me say I was on my period?<br>

What's with shaming? Pointing the finger<br>
blaming<br>
When it trickles down between your cheeks<br>
Dreaming oh so fast asleep<br>
And I accidentally make someone's bed sheet<br>
Look like the flag of Japan<br>

It's a cleanse<br>
She's powerful<br>
Emotions she will guide you through<br>
Hot sweats push you into<br>
Temperatures and<br>
Heartbeats faster<br>
As skin literally sheds<br>
Life's all about cycles<br>

Strong.<br>
Powerful.<br>
Catch it in a cup<br>
I'll put her in a metal bin if I really must but<br>
When I am eating my dinner<br>
Feeling emotionally heightened<br>
And you hear the word period<br>
And feel a bit frightened do not<br>
Laugh<br>
Unless of course it's at tampon tax<br>
