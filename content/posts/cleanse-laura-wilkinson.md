title: Cleanse by Laura Wilkinson
---
Why oh why  
When I was sat tucking into my pie last night  
Did a man behind me laugh  
When he heard me say I was on my period?  

What's with shaming? Pointing the finger  
blaming  
When it trickles down between your cheeks  
Dreaming oh so fast asleep  
And I accidentally make someone's bed sheet  
Look like the flag of Japan  

It's a cleanse  
She's powerful  
Emotions she will guide you through  
Hot sweats push you into  
Temperatures and  
Heartbeats faster  
As skin literally sheds  
Life's all about cycles  

Strong.  
Powerful.  
Catch it in a cup  
I'll put her in a metal bin if I really must but  
When I am eating my dinner  
Feeling emotionally heightened  
And you hear the word period  
And feel a bit frightened do not  
Laugh  
Unless of course it's at tampon tax
