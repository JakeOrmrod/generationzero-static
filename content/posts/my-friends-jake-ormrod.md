title: For My Friends by Jake Ormrod
---
This is for the friends who stand by me at my worst<br>
who don't shout or curse<br>
but understand my problems<br>
accept my flaws.<br>
They're the ones who make me pause<br>
and consider the cause of my passion and hard work.<br>

It is they who bring it to me.<br>

They do not know how much they've inspired<br>
how many times I've woke up despite being tired<br> 
to pen the end of a poem<br>
that may not carry their name<br>
but is an ode to who they are all the same.<br>

My drive is not fame.<br>
I am driven by friends,<br>
to articulate how they have made me who I am.<br>

A thousand thanks may be nice,<br>
but it is unrealistic<br>
so I'm hoping that this poem will suffice.<br>
