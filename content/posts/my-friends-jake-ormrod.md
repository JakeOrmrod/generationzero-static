title: For My Friends by Jake Ormrod
---
This is for the friends who stand by me at my worst  
who don't shout or curse  
but understand my problems  
accept my flaws.  
They're the ones who make me pause  
and consider the cause of my passion and hard work.  

It is they who bring it to me.  

They do not know how much they've inspired  
how many times I've woke up despite being tired<br> 
to pen the end of a poem  
that may not carry their name  
but is an ode to who they are all the same.  

My drive is not fame.  
I am driven by friends,  
to articulate how they have made me who I am.  

A thousand thanks may be nice,  
but it is unrealistic  
so I'm hoping that this poem will suffice.
