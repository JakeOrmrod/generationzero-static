title: a year (in three months) by Jake Ormrod

i can hear you crying from the hotel bed  
your anguish bouncing off the walls of the bathroom  
the wails unhinged  
binging on the regret that you let someone in  
someone not fit for purpose  
someone who has lured this need to cry out of you.  

what was once a fortress has crumbled, a crack made chasmic  
by another man who now joins the rank of problematic men you've let inside  
allowed them to hide in the rooms of your mind  
flip through the folds of your brain  
no shame  
because, with them  
with me  
in my arms  
you're free  
to let loose a past of tragedy and disaster  
faster to anger but closer to calm  
my voice a balm for your troubles.  

then you come out.  

your face is buried in a fresh white towel  
the rest of your body unleashed  
free from a leash that you've been straining against for years  
and you look up from the towel  
and there's tears  
and tears  
and  
tears  
saltwater filled with fears of a future without me  
without us.  

you apologize again for making a fuss  
i say that it's fine  
which makes you cry more,  
but with a smile this time.  
we keep fucking  
or making love  
i'm not sure which.  

you writhe  
and you moan  
and you scream  
and you twitch  
as i scratch an itch again and again  
and then we sleep.  
"hibernation" is what you call it  
filling up on me  
for free  
while you have it,  
before a year's big sleep  
a fevered sleep filled with dreams and nightmares  
as i creep from room to room  
in the house in your head  
infecting your memories from that hotel bed.  

breakfast is a blur  
but the walk to the station  
is a ten minute pilgrimage  
of a perfect image  
two lovers in the rain  
the beautifully grey stain of Manchester, a perfect backdrop.  

hugging and kissing for minutes seems essential  
as you wait for your train  
the hi-vis jackets of the men at work  
distracting me momentarily  
until you tell me you will always love me  
and i see tears on your cheeks,  
so i wipe them away  
and say that everything will be okay  
not believing myself  
but reassuring you anyway.  

i leave quickly as you walk to your train  
never knowing if you turned back to wave.  

you don't know  
but a piece of me leaves with you  
not in your head  
but your heart.
