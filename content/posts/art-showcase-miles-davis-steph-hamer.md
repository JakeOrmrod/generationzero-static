title: Art Showcase - Miles Davis by Steph Hamer
---
"Having always loved jazz but recently having a piqued interest in Miles Davis, I decided to give the Don Cheadle film ‘Miles Ahead’ a watch. Despite the film not leaving much of an impression on me, it inspired me and instantly made me want to draw, paint, create something – this illustration being the result."
