tea, cigarettes and incense<br>
colour my world<br>
as it turns<br>
and turns<br>
and turns<br>
and yearns for more<br>
as my dry lips suck tips of filters<br>
and the beer from last night<br>
continues to wear off.<br>

i wheeze and cough and think of you<br>
but not for too long<br>
before you're gone<br>
and it's back to clear sky.<br>

thoughts of therapy<br>
food<br>
unpaid debt<br>
a lack of water.<br>

i gulp at the clear liquid<br>
the cleansing essence<br>
spreading from kidneys to fingertips<br>
and then you're back again<br>
because distance doesn't make the heart grow fonder<br>
it makes the pain last longer<br>
and fosters a longing that is impossible to kill.<br>
