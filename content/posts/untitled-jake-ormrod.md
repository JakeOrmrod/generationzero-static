tea, cigarettes and incense  
colour my world  
as it turns  
and turns  
and turns  
and yearns for more  
as my dry lips suck tips of filters  
and the beer from last night  
continues to wear off.  

i wheeze and cough and think of you  
but not for too long  
before you're gone  
and it's back to clear sky.  

thoughts of therapy  
food  
unpaid debt  
a lack of water.  

i gulp at the clear liquid  
the cleansing essence  
spreading from kidneys to fingertips  
and then you're back again  
because distance doesn't make the heart grow fonder  
it makes the pain last longer  
and fosters a longing that is impossible to kill.
