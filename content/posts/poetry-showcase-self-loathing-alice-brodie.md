title: Poetry Showcase - Self-loathing by Alice Brodie
---
The poem below is from Alice Brodie, someone keeping herself to herself.  

**Self-loathing**  

All mirrors replaced with screens,  
I sit alone.  

I am a sixty four by sixty four pixel swastika in a box.  

Sometimes,  
when the battery is low,  
the screen dims,  
and my reflection appears.  

I have to look away.  

_**Alice is fond of lying in bed during daylight hours. She also likes writing, music and film.**_
