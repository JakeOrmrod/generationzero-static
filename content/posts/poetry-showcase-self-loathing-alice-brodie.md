title: Poetry Showcase - Self-loathing by Alice Brodie
---
The poem below is from Alice Brodie, someone keeping herself to herself.<br>

**Self-loathing**<br>

All mirrors replaced with screens,<br>
I sit alone.<br>

I am a sixty four by sixty four pixel swastika in a box.<br>

Sometimes,<br>
when the battery is low,<br>
the screen dims,<br>
and my reflection appears.<br>

I have to look away.<br>

_**Alice is fond of lying in bed during daylight hours. She also likes writing, music and film.**_
