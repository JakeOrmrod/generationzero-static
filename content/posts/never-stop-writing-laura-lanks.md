title: Never stop writing by Laura Lanks
---
Shapes take meaning  
When you decide on the order  
Somehow you jumble them up  
In a way that I understand  
You're speaking my language  
Don't drop the act  
The cat had my tongue  
Before you came along  

To some relaxed iris it's just black or blue on white  
Scribbles and sounds  
Hung midair for time  
For me they're notes chiming  
On crisp autumn branches  
That light that falls between the leaves  
The crunch when they hit the ground  
As magic as tiny crisp packets fresh out the oven  
Or making people come alive with salt dough  

I think I appreciate leaves more  
When they have left the tree  
Is that why they are called leaves?  
Because they leave?  
it's then I realise the time span  
That nothing is eternal  
Or forever  
Unless you freeze it  
But then we would turn to mush  
And we wouldn't be around to see it anyway  

So that moment of bated breath  
That second the cold steals it  
When your limbs feel like jelly  
Dipping your toe in a hot bath  
The wind chilling your teeth when you smile while riding your bike on a cold day  

Those moments  

For me you capture them  
Some how  
With the dainty lines that fall through your shoulder  
Into your arm  
Through your fingertips and into your pen  

Never stop writing  
You write oh so well
