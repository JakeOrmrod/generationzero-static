title: Never stop writing by Laura Lanks

Shapes take meaning<br>
When you decide on the order<br>
Somehow you jumble them up<br>
In a way that I understand<br>
You're speaking my language<br>
Don't drop the act<br>
The cat had my tongue<br>
Before you came along<br>

To some relaxed iris it's just black or blue on white<br>
Scribbles and sounds<br>
Hung midair for time<br>
For me they're notes chiming<br>
On crisp autumn branches<br>
That light that falls between the leaves<br>
The crunch when they hit the ground<br>
As magic as tiny crisp packets fresh out the oven<br>
Or making people come alive with salt dough<br>

I think I appreciate leaves more<br>
When they have left the tree<br>
Is that why they are called leaves?<br>
Because they leave?<br>
it's then I realise the time span<br>
That nothing is eternal<br>
Or forever<br>
Unless you freeze it<br>
But then we would turn to mush<br>
And we wouldn't be around to see it anyway<br>

So that moment of bated breath<br>
That second the cold steals it<br>
When your limbs feel like jelly<br>
Dipping your toe in a hot bath<br>
The wind chilling your teeth when you smile while riding your bike on a cold day<br>

Those moments<br>

For me you capture them<br>
Some how<br>
With the dainty lines that fall through your shoulder<br>
Into your arm<br>
Through your fingertips and into your pen<br>

Never stop writing<br>
You write oh so well<br>
