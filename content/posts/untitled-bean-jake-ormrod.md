being asked to fight the fright of yet another night  
without your body next to mine  
our limbs and souls entwined  
both our thoughts stuck together with loving glue, as we consider me and you,  
a future as two  

never alone  

with a view to  
partial compromises and hastily settled arguments  
that would end in pleasant death, a sweet release,  
as at least we had spent it together,  
braced the bad weather forever till that day.  

it is strife beyond words.  

my gut leaps a thousand stories at the thought  
on top of thought on top of thought on top of thought  
till my mind is fraught with mistakes and what-could-have-beens,  
two mungus beans in a world of our own making.  

was it ours for the taking?  

i’m sorry for speaking in clichés  
but it’s all i’m hearing,  
when someone tells me that time is healing i want to grab their watch  
smash the clocks  
turn off all phones  
remove time from this equation  
as its clear discrimination of me,  
throughout this slow crawl towards supposed independence  
is a poison that i’m not sure i can survive
