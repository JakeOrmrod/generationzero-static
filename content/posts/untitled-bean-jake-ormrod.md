being asked to fight the fright of yet another night<br>
without your body next to mine<br>
our limbs and souls entwined<br>
both our thoughts stuck together with loving glue, as we consider me and you,<br>
a future as two<br>

never alone<br>

with a view to<br>
partial compromises and hastily settled arguments<br>
that would end in pleasant death, a sweet release,<br>
as at least we had spent it together,<br>
braced the bad weather forever till that day.<br>

it is strife beyond words.<br>

my gut leaps a thousand stories at the thought<br>
on top of thought on top of thought on top of thought<br>
till my mind is fraught with mistakes and what-could-have-beens,<br>
two mungus beans in a world of our own making.<br>

was it ours for the taking?<br>

i’m sorry for speaking in clichés<br>
but it’s all i’m hearing,<br>
when someone tells me that time is healing i want to grab their watch<br>
smash the clocks<br>
turn off all phones<br>
remove time from this equation<br>
as its clear discrimination of me,<br>
throughout this slow crawl towards supposed independence<br>
is a poison that i’m not sure i can survive<br>
