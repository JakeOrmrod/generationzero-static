title: a year (in three months) by Jake Ormrod

i can hear you crying from the hotel bed<br>
your anguish bouncing off the walls of the bathroom<br>
the wails unhinged<br>
binging on the regret that you let someone in<br>
someone not fit for purpose<br>
someone who has lured this need to cry out of you.<br>

what was once a fortress has crumbled, a crack made chasmic<br>
by another man who now joins the rank of problematic men you've let inside<br>
allowed them to hide in the rooms of your mind<br>
flip through the folds of your brain<br>
no shame<br>
because, with them<br>
with me<br>
in my arms<br>
you're free<br>
to let loose a past of tragedy and disaster<br>
faster to anger but closer to calm<br>
my voice a balm for your troubles.<br>

then you come out.<br>

your face is buried in a fresh white towel<br>
the rest of your body unleashed<br>
free from a leash that you've been straining against for years<br>
and you look up from the towel<br>
and there's tears<br>
and tears<br>
and<br>
tears<br>
saltwater filled with fears of a future without me<br>
without us.<br>

you apologize again for making a fuss<br>
i say that it's fine<br>
which makes you cry more,<br>
but with a smile this time.<br>
we keep fucking<br>
or making love<br>
i'm not sure which.<br>

you writhe<br>
and you moan<br>
and you scream<br>
and you twitch<br>
as i scratch an itch again and again<br>
and then we sleep.<br>
"hibernation" is what you call it<br>
filling up on me<br>
for free<br>
while you have it,<br>
before a year's big sleep<br>
a fevered sleep filled with dreams and nightmares<br>
as i creep from room to room<br>
in the house in your head<br>
infecting your memories from that hotel bed.<br>

breakfast is a blur<br>
but the walk to the station<br>
is a ten minute pilgrimage<br>
of a perfect image<br>
two lovers in the rain<br>
the beautifully grey stain of Manchester, a perfect backdrop.<br>

hugging and kissing for minutes seems essential<br>
as you wait for your train<br>
the hi-vis jackets of the men at work<br>
distracting me momentarily<br>
until you tell me you will always love me<br>
and i see tears on your cheeks,<br>
so i wipe them away<br>
and say that everything will be okay<br>
not believing myself<br>
but reassuring you anyway.<br>

i leave quickly as you walk to your train<br>
never knowing if you turned back to wave.<br>

you don't know<br>
but a piece of me leaves with you<br>
not in your head<br>
but your heart.<br>
