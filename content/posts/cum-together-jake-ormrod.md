title: cum together by Jake Ormrod
---
i have often forgotten myself while lost inside of you<br>
the world no match for a smash and grab attack<br>
of lust and wonder<br>
of wet and warmth<br>
of suck and<br>
blow<br>
by<br>
blow<br>
the arguments<br> 
start to stack up<br>
that leaving your room is pointless<br>
when there’s nothing out there that can excite me quite like you<br>

there’s no such thing as come too soon<br>
inadequacy from years past<br>
combined with an SSRI<br>
held back at the crucial<br>
moment<br>
by<br>
moment<br>
i start to lose it<br>
torment<br>
to falter at your alter at the last second<br>

however<br>

on days and nights when the vibrations are right we<br>
come together in ecstasy on a sodden mattress<br>
our bodies denying the routine<br>
spurred on by each other<br>
into wave<br>
after wave<br>
of<br>
love<br>
