title: cum together by Jake Ormrod
---
i have often forgotten myself while lost inside of you  
the world no match for a smash and grab attack  
of lust and wonder  
of wet and warmth  
of suck and  
blow  
by  
blow  
the arguments<br> 
start to stack up  
that leaving your room is pointless  
when there’s nothing out there that can excite me quite like you  

there’s no such thing as come too soon  
inadequacy from years past  
combined with an SSRI  
held back at the crucial  
moment  
by  
moment  
i start to lose it  
torment  
to falter at your alter at the last second  

however  

on days and nights when the vibrations are right we  
come together in ecstasy on a sodden mattress  
our bodies denying the routine  
spurred on by each other  
into wave  
after wave  
of  
love
