Hammond, Johnson, Hunt or Gove.<br>
What a depressing Tory treasure trove,<br>
to decide from in the hope of fooling me<br>
as they watch with glee<br>
as May circles the drain<br>
her physical pain bringing a smile to the vile ranks that would wilfully refer to themselves as Tory.<br>

Leaders need to be boring.<br>
They have to be willing to accept snoring.<br>
Not hard line or charismatic like that sweater wearing Corbyn.<br>

We, collectively, stand on the precipice of possibility,<br>
too many of us unsure of which side<br>
unsure where to hide once it comes to the day when we must jump.<br>
There is no longer a middle ground.<br>
It has been carved up and cleaved open by the right wing and centre left<br>
leaving the country with only one opposition to the complete abolition of<br>
human rights<br>
public healthcare<br>
and basic decency.<br>

You either cower with them or stand with me,<br>
because for the first time in a long time<br>
we number in our millions,<br>
enough to shout back at the villains who would have you destitute.<br>
They would shoot if they could,<br>
but instead have to hide behind media lies that cause disabled lives to perish in their thousands.<br>

When it's all said and done,<br>
will you stand with us<br>
or will you stand dumb<br>
with those who believe fit for work is merely another phrase<br>
to help kill off those scrounging scum?<br>
