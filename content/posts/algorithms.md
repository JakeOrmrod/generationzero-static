title: Algorithms by Brit Medlock

“Who invented computer programming? Hint; child of Lord Byron.”  

I pipe up. “Ada Lovelace!” No, couldn’t be, a woman, surely not. I protest. Slosh my drink. Back myself. This is knowledge saved for a Very Special Occasion.<br> 

“Ada Lovelace.” The pause is several months pregnant.  

“And the answer to number 23 is in fact, Ada Lovelace!”<br> 

Perhaps this is the proudest I’ve been since graduation, perhaps this is my peak.  
Scratch that perhaps, I’m five pints in and flying.  

Someone asks about Ada and I explain her. She helped to develop the algorithm.  

You know, the natty little tool that tells you to invite the lad you like to your do.<br> 
That shows you sperm bank adverts on Facebook, your ex on Bumble, that recommends therapists and determines what’s relevant.  

“Self-determination died with newsfeed augmentation!”  

Another pause, this one considerably weightier. Conversation shuffles on, the next question is read out.<br> 

I stop for a minute, step down from my soapbox, take a sip. It was a nice line that one, fine, supplemented by wine and whining but a line nonetheless and yet, in that moment, I believe it to be true.<br> 

I open several of those little squares, close them, open them again. The screen thumbprinted and familiar.  


I don’t delete them, though.
