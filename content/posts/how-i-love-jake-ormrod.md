title: How I Love by Jake Ormrod
---
After ten years of mistrials and false starts,  
It has come to my attention that I do not nurture love,  
I smother it,  
I unintentionally kill and cover it  
in the pursuit of mutual affection.  

I cannot do what some do.  
I cannot love in half measures.  
I cannot boil love down to engagement treasures,  
Or expected dates  
or mortgage rates  
because I love in full.  

I can be vile and corrosive.  
I am soft and explosive  
and I could spend days apologising for what I am  
but it would not change how I love.  

For better or worse, how I love will leave behind all I am  
all I can be  
within the chambers of you.
