title: How I Love by Jake Ormrod
---
After ten years of mistrials and false starts,<br>
It has come to my attention that I do not nurture love,<br>
I smother it,<br>
I unintentionally kill and cover it<br>
in the pursuit of mutual affection.<br>

I cannot do what some do.<br>
I cannot love in half measures.<br>
I cannot boil love down to engagement treasures,<br>
Or expected dates<br>
or mortgage rates<br>
because I love in full.<br>

I can be vile and corrosive.<br>
I am soft and explosive<br>
and I could spend days apologising for what I am<br>
but it would not change how I love.<br>

For better or worse, how I love will leave behind all I am<br>
all I can be<br>
within the chambers of you.<br>
