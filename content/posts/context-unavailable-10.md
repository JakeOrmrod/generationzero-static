‘context unavailable’ is a collaborative project between old friends Jake Ormrod and Stephanie Hamer. It explores the importance of context within art, asking whether something creative truly needs an explanation.  
  
Each week one of the duo will create a piece of work and present it without context, the other artist then tasked with creating a response.
