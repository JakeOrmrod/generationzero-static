does anybody know how to  
not be scared any more ?  
i don’t know my own poor self  
my time is taken up with  
decision making remember when  
the days were full of hours they  
never ran out and  
happiness could always be found  
down a side street just by  
looking up or  
maybe under a garbage bin  
now life’s new rule  
every second not spent  
busy is wasted  
every minute not spent with<br> 
you is wasted time  
someone once said to me  
but i didn’t believe it then<br> 
because i was young and  
love was a joke  
still is, really  
when will i feel older and<br> 
wiser  
no longer  
scared when the sun<br> 
sets and rises  
a new day equals fear  
chasing my own head and  
the devil right out of it  
remember when we didn’t  
care everything was just  
easy  
now i live in this  
room of quiet terror  
scared to open my  
mouth scared of  
questions  
remember when i<br> 
believed my own  
gorgeous value
