does anybody know how to<br>
not be scared any more ?<br>
i don’t know my own poor self<br>
my time is taken up with<br>
decision making remember when<br>
the days were full of hours they<br>
never ran out and<br>
happiness could always be found<br>
down a side street just by<br>
looking up or<br>
maybe under a garbage bin<br>
now life’s new rule<br>
every second not spent<br>
busy is wasted<br>
every minute not spent with<br> 
you is wasted time<br>
someone once said to me<br>
but i didn’t believe it then<br> 
because i was young and<br>
love was a joke<br>
still is, really<br>
when will i feel older and<br> 
wiser<br>
no longer<br>
scared when the sun<br> 
sets and rises<br>
a new day equals fear<br>
chasing my own head and<br>
the devil right out of it<br>
remember when we didn’t<br>
care everything was just<br>
easy<br>
now i live in this<br>
room of quiet terror<br>
scared to open my<br>
mouth scared of<br>
questions<br>
remember when i<br> 
believed my own<br>
gorgeous value<br>
