title: "pla\xE7a de mercat poem by Jenny Browne"
---
sun’s warm tongue<br>
licks at the corners<br>
walls of houses<br>
bathed in yellow<br>
balconies built of<br>
roses flags strung<br>
flapping wildly<br>
so many curves<br>

i could be<br>
running<br>
fingers down your<br>
outline in my head<br>
comparing your<br>
dips and swells to<br>
that green villa<br>
on the carrer de la<br>
boatella<br>
my darling<br>
how it loops around<br>
toward the orange<br> 
tree<br>
and you bend<br>
to my will<br>

i should hang from<br> 
you a flower<br>
basket creeping<br>
wisteria entwining<br>
wrapping<br>
flesh to flesh oh<br>
if i had roots i <br>
would grow into<br>
you<br>

the veranda could<br>
become your<br>
shrine     every drip<br> 
of morning dew<br>
settled on a petal<br>
reflection of<br>
perfect nipple<br>
toasting the sun<br>
standing to attention<br>

this morning<br>
the blinds drawn<br>
half up half<br>
folded as the <br>
sheet covers only<br>
half of you<br>

what’s left <br>
splayed out <br>
in the<br>
sun fragments of<br>
light bounce off<br>
your bones<br>
tangled in a<br>
matted crown of<br>
morning hair<br>
leaning in close<br> 
enough to <br>
feel your breath<br> 
on me but i don’t<br>
touch you<br>
not just yet<br>

you rest in the <br>
soft deep soil<br>
warmed by the<br>
spanish sun<br>
in your own leafy<br>
corner of the<br>
flower box or<br>
maybe heaven<br>
strung<br>
up<br>
admiring the<br>
view as i <br>
do you<br>
