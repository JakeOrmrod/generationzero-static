title: "pla\xE7a de mercat poem by Jenny Browne"
---
sun’s warm tongue  
licks at the corners  
walls of houses  
bathed in yellow  
balconies built of  
roses flags strung  
flapping wildly  
so many curves  

i could be  
running  
fingers down your  
outline in my head  
comparing your  
dips and swells to  
that green villa  
on the carrer de la  
boatella  
my darling  
how it loops around  
toward the orange<br> 
tree  
and you bend  
to my will  

i should hang from<br> 
you a flower  
basket creeping  
wisteria entwining  
wrapping  
flesh to flesh oh  
if i had roots i   
would grow into  
you  

the veranda could  
become your  
shrine     every drip<br> 
of morning dew  
settled on a petal  
reflection of  
perfect nipple  
toasting the sun  
standing to attention  

this morning  
the blinds drawn  
half up half  
folded as the   
sheet covers only  
half of you  

what’s left   
splayed out   
in the  
sun fragments of  
light bounce off  
your bones  
tangled in a  
matted crown of  
morning hair  
leaning in close<br> 
enough to   
feel your breath<br> 
on me but i don’t  
touch you  
not just yet  

you rest in the   
soft deep soil  
warmed by the  
spanish sun  
in your own leafy  
corner of the  
flower box or  
maybe heaven  
strung  
up  
admiring the  
view as i   
do you
