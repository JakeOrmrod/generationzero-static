title: I'd Die For You by Hebe Reilly
---
If I were still in love with you;<br> 
I’d buy you this book.<br> 

You’d enjoy the long lost element of the tale,  
gold lettering on hardback teal,  
hints of a classy generation,  
that only exists in fiction.  

A time for monocled men and long skirted ladies,  
saving their ankles for those in the other room,  
sipping liquor, smoking opium,  
indulgent conversation.  

If I were still in love with you;  
I’d buy you this book.  

I’d enjoy your smile as you placed it carefully between fingertips,  
watch with joy as the words light up your eyes.  

I think this,  
   standing alone,  
    in a bookshop.  
6 years after we said goodbye,  
    realising:  
love never really dies.  

Even after opening itself like a crisp, linen hankie,  
repeatedly creased and crumbled,  
and returned, different somehow, ruined, slightly.  
It never will fit, again, just right,  
in the top pocket of my dad’s blazer.  

But, I can breathe with your memory,  
        now;  
think of a time when this gift would have made your day.  

Now I'm sure you wouldn’t know what to say,<br> 
you’d think me mad, or pathetic and certainly a little sad.<br> 
To bring you a smile after all these years,  
after teasing and provoking all those tears,  
but still, somehow, love resonates when struck,<br> 
glancing at F.Scott Fitzgerald’s forgotten book,<br> 
Even after all these years.
