title: I'd Die For You by Hebe Reilly
---
If I were still in love with you;<br> 
I’d buy you this book.<br> 

You’d enjoy the long lost element of the tale,<br>
gold lettering on hardback teal,<br>
hints of a classy generation,<br>
that only exists in fiction.<br>

A time for monocled men and long skirted ladies,<br>
saving their ankles for those in the other room,<br>
sipping liquor, smoking opium,<br>
indulgent conversation.<br>

If I were still in love with you;<br>
I’d buy you this book.<br>

I’d enjoy your smile as you placed it carefully between fingertips,<br>
watch with joy as the words light up your eyes.<br>

I think this,<br>
   standing alone,<br>
    in a bookshop.<br>
6 years after we said goodbye,<br>
    realising:<br>
love never really dies.<br>

Even after opening itself like a crisp, linen hankie,<br>
repeatedly creased and crumbled,<br>
and returned, different somehow, ruined, slightly.<br>
It never will fit, again, just right,<br>
in the top pocket of my dad’s blazer.<br>

But, I can breathe with your memory,<br>
        now;<br>
think of a time when this gift would have made your day.<br>

Now I'm sure you wouldn’t know what to say,<br> 
you’d think me mad, or pathetic and certainly a little sad.<br> 
To bring you a smile after all these years,<br>
after teasing and provoking all those tears,<br>
but still, somehow, love resonates when struck,<br> 
glancing at F.Scott Fitzgerald’s forgotten book,<br> 
Even after all these years.<br>
