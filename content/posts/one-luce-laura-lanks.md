title: One for Luce by Laura Lanks
---
Counting days, tallying weeks  
Our story being built  
Brick by brick  
Slowly slowly take it all in  
The rushes I get when I feel your skin  
When I harvest your kisses and I catch your eye  
And right in the middle it reflects the sky  
Or it transforms into a sunflower  
In a tiny ocean too  
420 different shades of marbled blue  
One for each day  
A different outfit if you will  
Because each day shapes us  
And So your eyes change too  
They grow and look deeper  
They open up for me  
So inside I can dip my toes<br> 
In your tiny little sea  
The honest gaze and sometimes<br> 
I feel like I haven't looked in days  
I mean I've looked  
But I haven't looked  
And then I look  
And I fall  
And I remember how I fell  
And I'm granted another plunge  
Inside your wishing well
