Plucked from earthen womb  
twisted, gently  
yellow moonface,  
wintery mane  
pressed between a withered page  
forgotten till the edges grey  
your memories sepia, and fade.  

An open book, you're sure to fall.  

Your bonnet drifts in patches  
flutters and singles with dust  
in grooves of heavy footsteps  
traipsed to the yard,  
in your family plot.  

Ash, you drift in scented breeze  
and birth the next doomed, flowered breed.
