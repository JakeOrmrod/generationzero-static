title: Untitled by Simon Fruin
---
Plucked from earthen womb<br>
twisted, gently<br>
yellow moonface,<br>
wintery mane<br>
pressed between a withered page<br>
forgotten till the edges grey<br>
your memories sepia, and fade.<br>

An open book, you're sure to fall.<br>

Your bonnet drifts in patches<br>
flutters and singles with dust<br>
in grooves of heavy footsteps<br>
traipsed to the yard,<br>
in your family plot.<br>

Ash, you drift in scented breeze<br>
and birth the next doomed, flowered breed.<br>
