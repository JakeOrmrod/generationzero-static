title: Poetry Showcase - Bitter End by Sam Lee-Potter
---
On the mountain  
The Neanderthal kneels softly onto cool stone  
Blood glistening in the night  
Final breaths turn to silver  

A mile below  

Heavenly bodies find him  
Hands trembling over torn flesh  
Teeth clenched  
Eyes fastened in envy  

**_
Sam is from the North West doing time in the Far East._**
