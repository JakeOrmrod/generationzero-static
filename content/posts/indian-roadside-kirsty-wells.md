title: Indian Roadside by Kirsty Wells
---
After some time I decline to notice  
stacks of rubbish, littering road margins.  
Instead of grassy verges, plastic piled;  
bottles, bags, polystyrene, tyres,  
metal scraps and everything in between  
covering the sandy roadâ€™s edge.  

Fruit sellers interspersed between patches  
stood behind coconut laden carts.  
Lone cows tethered or ranging  
peacefully amidst the chaos of the road.  
Vehicles of assorted shapes, sizes  
battle for places with a chorus of beeping  
horns, leaving lanes a mystery unto itself.
