title: Indian Roadside by Kirsty Wells

After some time I decline to notice<br>
stacks of rubbish, littering road margins.<br>
Instead of grassy verges, plastic piled;<br>
bottles, bags, polystyrene, tyres,<br>
metal scraps and everything in between<br>
covering the sandy roadâ€™s edge.<br>

Fruit sellers interspersed between patches<br>
stood behind coconut laden carts.<br>
Lone cows tethered or ranging<br>
peacefully amidst the chaos of the road.<br>
Vehicles of assorted shapes, sizes<br>
battle for places with a chorus of beeping<br>
horns, leaving lanes a mystery unto itself.<br>
