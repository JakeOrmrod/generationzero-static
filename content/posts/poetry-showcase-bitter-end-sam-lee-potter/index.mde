title: Poetry Showcase - Bitter End by Sam Lee-Potter
---
On the mountain<br>
The Neanderthal kneels softly onto cool stone<br>
Blood glistening in the night<br>
Final breaths turn to silver<br>

A mile below<br>

Heavenly bodies find him<br>
Hands trembling over torn flesh<br>
Teeth clenched<br>
Eyes fastened in envy<br>
