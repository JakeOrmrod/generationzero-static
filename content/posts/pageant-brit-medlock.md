She lies in the dark, shrouded in sleep, heavy with memory.<br>
The skeleton of her bed sags under the weight of blanket and body,<br>
its bones as tired as hers;<br>
each has stories, each keeps secrets.<br>
She is swaddled in silks, frayed, papery with dust.<br>
The hoary record crackles, well acquainted with its role.<br>

This bed was her castle.<br>

One by one she sees them enter, a peacocking procession.<br>
First, the straw-haired boy whose lips still brush her cheeks.<br>
Second, the gray-eyed stranger whose hands still haunt her wrists.<br>
Third, the quiet gentleman whose words still fill her lungs.<br>

More and more they come,<br>
make their journey, pay their respects.<br>
Every lover she ever took; the ones who paid, the ones who left.<br>
They hover, she waits. Oh, how she has waited.<br>
Her throat is thick with the sight of them, with the years of them,<br>
and she cannot help but quiver.<br>
Each still holds a part of her; some stolen, some given.<br>

This bed was her castle.<br> 

As they pass they touch their hats, stroke their brows and look away.<br> 
The old song begins to call and the figures start to fade.<br> 
Some part with their coins, they know the boatman must be paid.<br> 
She breathes out softly, so softly, softer still.<br>  
Familiar notes shimmer, the murmuring memories quelled.<br>

This bed was her castle; who can tell when she lost the key.
