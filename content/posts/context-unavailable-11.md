‘context unavailable’ is a collaborative project between old friends Jake Ormrod and Stephanie Hamer. It explores the importance of context within art, asking whether something creative truly needs an explanation.<br>
<br>
Each week one of the duo will create a piece of work and present it without context, the other artist then tasked with creating a response.<br>
