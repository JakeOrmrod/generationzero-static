title: Bombay Mix by Jake Ormrod
---
it's in one of those bowls<br>
the little things<br>
with the name that sounds like mannequin<br>
and i only bought it to speak to the barmaid<br>
but i should've picked a snack<br>
you don't have to eat by the handful<br>
it's undignified<br>
and i can see her interest wain with every mouthful<br>
