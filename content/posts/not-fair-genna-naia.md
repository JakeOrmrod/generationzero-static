title: Not Fair by Genna Naia
---
It's not fair that you're angry  
It's not fair that you've been made to cope  
It's not fair that you've had no one to hear you  
When you don't even know what to speak  

It's not fair that your life is unfair  
A child in an adult world  
A nasty world  
Unfair  

Be beautiful and bright because the world needs to hear from you the most  
Be defiant and mean to make the world shake  
Use and abuse your anger to manipulate it into kind words  
Wise words  
Age old at the age of seven  

It's not fair that you're angry  
It's not fair that you've been made to cope  

Use and abuse your anger, baby  
Be your superhero  
You don't need the invisible cloak
