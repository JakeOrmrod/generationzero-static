paul o’grady is chatting an old flame i haven’t seen in person in years into fucking me on a cold metal bed in a cell that resides at the top of a bland future building while i complete the fourth of four trials to get us out of there, the incarceration part of our punishment for standing against the relentless wave of standardisation taking the world by storm each day that passes but i eventually get us out the constant crowd of homeless mixing with suits leading us to leave the centre hand in hand till we’re walking a grey serpentine road that trails off from everyone else while top gear crackles in the background from the skies descending an angel chorus of alarm.

I wake up too early.
