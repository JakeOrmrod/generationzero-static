title: Poetry Showcase - Father Figures by Simon Fruin
---
Glitter tooth traitors hang from fishing line,<br>
Spiral and spin, boots knock the windows<br>
Crack the panes and shake the frames<br>
The wood splinters -<br>
the sun flickers and bursts to dust in the sky<br>
The pitter patter of crows feet peck at the eyes<br> 
That peek through knitted fingers, tar stained<br> 
Smelling of leather,<br>
Tasting of never.<br>

My childhood face, painted in diesel-rainbowed puddles,<br>
So deep with the grit that burrows beneath your skin,<br>
Holy tattoos spell out sepsis<br>
The fever burns in bitter hacks,<br>
Its echoes stir him back around<br>
His chapped grin beckoning you with three-ply promises<br>

“Do you dream of me? I dream of you”<br>
(I dream of you too)<br>
I look to the ground<br>
His cackles clash with the morning<br>
Splash colour on your cheeks<br>
You open your mouth to speak<br>
I close my eyes,<br>
Finally sleep<br>
