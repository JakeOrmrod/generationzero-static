title: Poetry Showcase - Father Figures by Simon Fruin
---
Glitter tooth traitors hang from fishing line,  
Spiral and spin, boots knock the windows  
Crack the panes and shake the frames  
The wood splinters -  
the sun flickers and bursts to dust in the sky  
The pitter patter of crows feet peck at the eyes<br> 
That peek through knitted fingers, tar stained<br> 
Smelling of leather,  
Tasting of never.  

My childhood face, painted in diesel-rainbowed puddles,  
So deep with the grit that burrows beneath your skin,  
Holy tattoos spell out sepsis  
The fever burns in bitter hacks,  
Its echoes stir him back around  
His chapped grin beckoning you with three-ply promises  

“Do you dream of me? I dream of you”  
(I dream of you too)  
I look to the ground  
His cackles clash with the morning  
Splash colour on your cheeks  
You open your mouth to speak  
I close my eyes,  
Finally sleep
