title: Summer In Central India by Kirsty Wells
---
**"With the wind in my hair, perched on the back seats of the open jeep, we drove for hours. 
During a 2 week filming project in Madhya Pradesh, I accompanied Tarun Bhati – the manager of the safari lodge I was producing a promo video for – and some of his close friends as he showed them a new site they had purchased, in order to build another commercial property.
It was the peak of summer. Daily temperatures averaging 42 degrees. I spent the entire journey completely absorbed with the landscape we thundered through. 
The words of this poem came to me as we drove and very unusually I managed to retain them, to later jot them down as a note on my phone."**

Dust sprays and fills my mouth  
and eyes as we drive  
through a vast desert. Like salt,  
trees and huts sprinkled  
across an otherwise  
featureless landscape.  

A neatly carved patchwork  
quilt ladens the land,  
embellished with reds and rust  
under blazing sun.  
Defined by steep banks, once  
swamped rice fields lie parched.  

Like clutching hands, green  
forest marks the horizon.  
Individual trees indistinguishable<br> 
in dense lush stands,  
provide a stark reminder  
of an untouched lands potential.  

Perhaps without flourish,  
though still life continues.  
Birds chirp and zoom  
through the open air,  
children laugh, yell and cry  
whilst their elders look on patiently.  

Almost comical pom pom trees  
sparsely scattered,  
many species each with  
perfectly round, leafy crowns,  
held to the thirsty earth  
by lollipop stick trunks.  

Roaming cattle graze the bald,  
brown ground, almost as skeletal  
as the paddies through  
which they wander.  
Bells hung from fine necks jingle  
as their ribs catch the sunlight.  

Locals working arid fields serve  
at the elements mercy.  
Attending the stagnant pools and<br> 
dried river beds of this plain,  
day upon day beneath passing clouds,  
helplessly they await the rain.
