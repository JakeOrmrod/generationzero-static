title: women by Jake Ormrod
---
forget the inventions  
the social change  
and the love  
forget that one held us in their womb for months  
because I’m sick of trying to explain why I care  
that women<br> 
like me  
deserve a world that is fair  
that their worth is not defined by my errant gaze  
or how they make this world better in innumerable ways  
they’re beings  
they exist  
and for me that’s enough  
to ensure that their lives are not needlessly tough  
so today  
of all days  
lets please come together  
and realise that genitals are not our common tether  
that just like us  
they are human  
and deserve equality  
deserve a life, a world, and a body that is free
