title: Gen Zero Playlist - RIP MES
---
With the passing of Mark E Smith, we wanted to put together a small playlist that showed off the genius of The Fall. This one is especially for those who haven't yet seen the light, who don't see The Fall as one of the greatest bands of all time. We hope you will change your mind after hearing this collection of songs and choose to dive head first into the rest of their works. RIP MES.
