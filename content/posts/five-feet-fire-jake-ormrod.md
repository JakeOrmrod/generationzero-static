summary: ''
title: five feet of fire by Jake Ormrod
---
one woman with the strength of thousands<br>
driven<br>
proud and beautiful<br>
fruitful<br>
outspoken in her ways<br>
spends days pushing back<br>
against those who donâ€™t deserve her<br>
attacks life with a fervour i find inspiring<br>
enlivening<br>
her passion is infectious<br>
five feet of fire<br>
in a world drenched in complacency<br>
