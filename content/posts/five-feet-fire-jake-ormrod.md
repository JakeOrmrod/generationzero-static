title: five feet of fire by Jake Ormrod
---
one woman with the strength of thousands  
driven  
proud and beautiful  
fruitful  
outspoken in her ways  
spends days pushing back  
against those who donâ€™t deserve her  
attacks life with a fervour i find inspiring  
enlivening  
her passion is infectious  
five feet of fire  
in a world drenched in complacency
