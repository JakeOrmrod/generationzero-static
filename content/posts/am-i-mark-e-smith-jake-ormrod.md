title: Am I Mark E. Smith? by Jake Ormrod
---
We spoke about him  
in bed,  
how my head was similar  
sinister  
unable to see life beyond extremes.  

Now you're gone,  
and the fear of streams  
carrying me far away  
are hard to erase  
just days to consider why you left  
why my head is bereft of the necessary terms to keep you here.  

Your departure is one in a long line  
meaning it's time to ask  
Am I Mark E. Smith?  

Not if I have his wit  
or his writing agility  
or if i'm slowly building up to his drinking ability  
but if i'm a git who is destined to this  
who will poke, prod and push  
the people he loves  
till they're gone.  

My answer is no.  
I Am Not Mark E. Smith.  

I am a man in control  
one who wants out of this  
who is slowly climbing his way  
out of this combative abyss.  

I hope you will join me  
be my teammate through this shift,  
and will see that, most definitely,  
I Am Not Mark E. Smith.
