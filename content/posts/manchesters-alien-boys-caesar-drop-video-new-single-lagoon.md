RELEASE DATE: 15 May 2017, Blak Hand Records

Blak Hand Records are set to release CAESAR’s next single with a brand new video for ‘A Lagoon’. 
Describing their sound as ‘alien music’, the quartet push the creative experimentation of indie and shoegaze to its limit, writing lengthy compositions that whisk listeners through dream-like experiences and draw immediate comparisons to the likes of Real Estate and Cloud Nothings.

‘A Lagoon’ is the second single from CAESAR this year, following February’s digital release of the soothing ‘Crossed Wires’. The two tracks merely serve as a welcoming preview of what’s to come on the band’s very first headline UK tour. Kicking off in Manchester on Tuesday 16 May at the underground Northern Quarter venue Soup Kitchen, CAESAR are about to take the over the indie-scene with shows country-wide, from up north in Liverpool to down south in London.

CAESAR’s ‘A Lagoon’ is released on 15th May via Blak Hand Records and will be available on iTunes and Spotify. Digital downloads of the track will be available from the Blak Hand Records Bandcamp store.

Video - Produced and shot by Indianna River
