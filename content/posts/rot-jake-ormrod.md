Forgetting how to love<br>
How to wake up with more<br>
Than the maw of your face<br>
In my mind<br>
Is killing me.<br>

I feel invalid<br>
Ugly<br>
Unhappy<br>
Alone and impotent<br>
Your potent memory a reminder of what I can almost be<br>

I am a tree<br>
Whose roots are rotten<br>
I must be removed to save you<br>
For fear it'll spread<br>
And leave you dead<br>

Some dread filled you<br>
Killed us<br>
Because of my faults.<br>
