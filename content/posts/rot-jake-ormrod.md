Forgetting how to love  
How to wake up with more  
Than the maw of your face  
In my mind  
Is killing me.  

I feel invalid  
Ugly  
Unhappy  
Alone and impotent  
Your potent memory a reminder of what I can almost be  

I am a tree  
Whose roots are rotten  
I must be removed to save you  
For fear it'll spread  
And leave you dead  

Some dread filled you  
Killed us  
Because of my faults.
