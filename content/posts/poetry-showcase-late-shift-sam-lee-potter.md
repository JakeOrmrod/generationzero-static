title: Poetry Showcase - Late Shift by Sam Lee-Potter
---
Here we have a poem from Sam Lee-Potter, a close friend currently living in China.

**Late Shift**

Night reveals a field  
Of half-light static,  
Shapes dance, surrender  
To the mindâ€™s eye  
The room dilates, fades out to  
Warm touch, flashing smiles  

**_
Sam is from the North West doing time in the Far East._**
