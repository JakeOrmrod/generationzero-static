title: Poetry Showcase - Late Shift by Sam Lee-Potter
---
Here we have a poem from Sam Lee-Potter, a close friend currently living in China.

**Late Shift**

Night reveals a field<br>
Of half-light static,<br>
Shapes dance, surrender<br>
To the mindâ€™s eye<br>
The room dilates, fades out to<br>
Warm touch, flashing smiles<br>
