You got ants in your pants?  
Why can’t you sit still?  
You left your PE kit again  
Now you can’t do ball skills  
Look who’s late again  
But you don’t even look sorry  
Eyes wide I keep my pride  
Then leave class in a hurry  
 
If the teacher had a dunce hat  
It would be planted on me  
Ears poking out of the sides and all eyes on me  
All eyes on me  
All eyes on me  
But mine are flitting from pillar to post  
Trying to sit still but I’m popping like toast  
Every five seconds  
Those ants are biting me  
I just can’t hold my focus for more than 2, 3  
 
“Doctor, Doctor, my child is failing school  
Not interested in class and he can’t follow rules  
He is truanting and climbing and is in the wrong crowd  
I’d rather home school him but that’s not allowed”  
 
“Don’t worry miss, your son will be fine  
He has the brain of a man but the body of 9  
attention like a fish  
but energy of a storm  
I have a solution for you  
And it comes in pill form”  
 
Ritalin, Concerta, amphetamine based  
Adverse effects and weighed to your taste  
You can come and pick them up once per week  
You can bet your bottom dollar that your son will sleep  
Even when he’s talking, when he’s walking,  
Your son will feel in slumber  
Your son will sleep  
 
On interview today he was pleasant and cooperative.  
He attended on time and he was unaccompanied  
He was calm and relaxed and developed good rapport  
His speech was normal in rate, tone volume and score  
Mood was subjectively and objectively euthymic.  
There was no evidence of a formal thought disorder.  
Cognitively he was alert and orientated to time, place and person.  
He has taken the medication as prescribed and continues to benefit from this  
but does require a higher dose as above  
but does require a higher dose as above  
but does require a higher dose as above  
 
eyes closed head back  
swallow your pills  
drowsiness, nausea  
a severe lack of thrills  
erectile dysfunction  
head thumping  
you never want to eat  
 
but now my son is never late  
and he don’t scream in the street  
 
the ants still bite me  
I just can’t feel them now  
but I’m always on time  
and I don’t scream in the street
