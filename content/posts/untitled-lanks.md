You got ants in your pants?<br>
Why can’t you sit still?<br>
You left your PE kit again<br>
Now you can’t do ball skills<br>
Look who’s late again<br>
But you don’t even look sorry<br>
Eyes wide I keep my pride<br>
Then leave class in a hurry<br>
 
If the teacher had a dunce hat<br>
It would be planted on me<br>
Ears poking out of the sides and all eyes on me<br>
All eyes on me<br>
All eyes on me<br>
But mine are flitting from pillar to post<br>
Trying to sit still but I’m popping like toast<br>
Every five seconds<br>
Those ants are biting me<br>
I just can’t hold my focus for more than 2, 3<br>
 
“Doctor, Doctor, my child is failing school<br>
Not interested in class and he can’t follow rules<br>
He is truanting and climbing and is in the wrong crowd<br>
I’d rather home school him but that’s not allowed”<br>
 
“Don’t worry miss, your son will be fine<br>
He has the brain of a man but the body of 9<br>
attention like a fish<br>
but energy of a storm<br>
I have a solution for you<br>
And it comes in pill form”<br>
 
Ritalin, Concerta, amphetamine based<br>
Adverse effects and weighed to your taste<br>
You can come and pick them up once per week<br>
You can bet your bottom dollar that your son will sleep<br>
Even when he’s talking, when he’s walking,<br>
Your son will feel in slumber<br>
Your son will sleep<br>
 
On interview today he was pleasant and cooperative.<br>
He attended on time and he was unaccompanied<br>
He was calm and relaxed and developed good rapport<br>
His speech was normal in rate, tone volume and score<br>
Mood was subjectively and objectively euthymic.<br>
There was no evidence of a formal thought disorder.<br>
Cognitively he was alert and orientated to time, place and person.<br>
He has taken the medication as prescribed and continues to benefit from this<br>
but does require a higher dose as above<br>
but does require a higher dose as above<br>
but does require a higher dose as above<br>
 
eyes closed head back<br>
swallow your pills<br>
drowsiness, nausea<br>
a severe lack of thrills<br>
erectile dysfunction<br>
head thumping<br>
you never want to eat<br>
 
but now my son is never late<br>
and he don’t scream in the street<br>
 
the ants still bite me<br>
I just can’t feel them now<br>
but I’m always on time<br>
and I don’t scream in the street<br>
