title: One for Luce by Laura Lanks
---
Counting days, tallying weeks<br>
Our story being built<br>
Brick by brick<br>
Slowly slowly take it all in<br>
The rushes I get when I feel your skin<br>
When I harvest your kisses and I catch your eye<br>
And right in the middle it reflects the sky<br>
Or it transforms into a sunflower<br>
In a tiny ocean too<br>
420 different shades of marbled blue<br>
One for each day<br>
A different outfit if you will<br>
Because each day shapes us<br>
And So your eyes change too<br>
They grow and look deeper<br>
They open up for me<br>
So inside I can dip my toes<br> 
In your tiny little sea<br>
The honest gaze and sometimes<br> 
I feel like I haven't looked in days<br>
I mean I've looked<br>
But I haven't looked<br>
And then I look<br>
And I fall<br>
And I remember how I fell<br>
And I'm granted another plunge<br>
Inside your wishing well<br>
