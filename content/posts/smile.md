title: smile
---
sticky tendrils drip<br> 
between your fingers as you force me to  
lick suck and kiss  
them till they’re covered in spit before stopping a second  
and biting your lip  
taking a moment before smiling.  

the one that betrays your intent  
hell bent on sex  
while also hiding a lifetime  
and what moves you’ll make next.  

i feel blissfully pointless when you shine  
every tooth in your mouth  
the curves at the side mimicking mine  

after edging seconds from my mind  
you shift  
and the digits are gone
