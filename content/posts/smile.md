title: smile
---
sticky tendrils drip<br> 
between your fingers as you force me to<br>
lick suck and kiss<br>
them till they’re covered in spit before stopping a second<br>
and biting your lip<br>
taking a moment before smiling.<br>

the one that betrays your intent<br>
hell bent on sex<br>
while also hiding a lifetime<br>
and what moves you’ll make next.<br>

i feel blissfully pointless when you shine<br>
every tooth in your mouth<br>
the curves at the side mimicking mine<br>

after edging seconds from my mind<br>
you shift<br>
and the digits are gone<br>
