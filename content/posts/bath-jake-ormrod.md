title: bath by Jake Ormrod
---
water taps<br>
at my toes<br>
the heat close to discomfort<br>

i got in dry<br>
to take<br>
a look at myself<br>

an extra<br>
five minutes<br>
to add to years of<br>

judgement<br>
self-obsession<br>
and insecurity<br>

until<br>
the water<br>
rises above my stomach<br>

ripples distort me<br>
comfort<br>
for another day<br>
