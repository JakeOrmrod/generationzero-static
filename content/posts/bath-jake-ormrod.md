title: bath by Jake Ormrod
---
water taps  
at my toes  
the heat close to discomfort  

i got in dry  
to take  
a look at myself  

an extra  
five minutes  
to add to years of  

judgement  
self-obsession  
and insecurity  

until  
the water  
rises above my stomach  

ripples distort me  
comfort  
for another day
