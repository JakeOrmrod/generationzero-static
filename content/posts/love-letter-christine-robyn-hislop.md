title: Poetry Showcase - Love Letter To Christine By Robyn Hislop
---
Paused amid an inhale,<br> 
With nothing more pleasurable than a point to make<br> 
Yet God forbid I exhale and risk the headache<br>
Of having a flag to stick in the ground.<br>
But when I’m older right, when I grow up,<br> 
I’ll do something to make me admired<br>
Mid-twenties, mid-mind fuck, fully uninspired.<br>

Then week 25 of 52 I fell in love with you.<br>

Tilted it was and jilted I became by my own perception -<br>
Nothing but a self-deception that my life is still all to play for.<br>
Transfixed on¬¬ pin-balling hips and fearlessly tell-all lips,<br>
Your razor-sharp conviction had me whipped<br>
And whipped me into shape.<br>
Brick by brick, inhales swell to a puffed out chest,<br>
Now not only God knows I can be my best.<br>
Who’d have guessed, in a mind’s cardiac arrest,<br>
My potential compressed<br>
That Saint Claude would have me blessed.<br>

Because that feeling’s been fading these years,<br>
That I could stand on shoulders and speak to have people hear,<br>
Where I’m coming from.<br>
Truth be told it was long gone.<br>
Stranded somewhere down that ‘right path’,<br>
Thumb out, hollowed by doubt,<br>
Losing track of what this is all about.<br>
But you were born from this,<br>
Whispering fantasies of an epicene kiss.<br>
Championing the intricacies I’ve felt<br>
With the crotch vindicated under your belt.<br>
Owning the four corners, limbs sprawled,<br>
Soloing a dogma that has me enthralled,<br>
Yes I had stalled.<br>

But if you can now only reminisce,<br>
Of how you were born from this,<br>
It can only be my time to be illuminated,<br>
Drag me up to a form anticipated.<br>
