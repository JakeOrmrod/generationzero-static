title: 'Poems of Los Anchos #2 - Albacete by Jenny Browne'
---
_It’s just gone 9am and the sun is gradually getting quite unbearable, but I am under a tree in the ‘lung of Albacete’ – the Parque Abelardo Sanchez. A group of schoolgirls are doing a synchronised danced routine to a Little Mix song. I’ve washed my face upside down with a bottle of water and eaten my last orange. These are the best oranges I have ever eaten.
